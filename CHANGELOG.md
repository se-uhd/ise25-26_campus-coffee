- Move common logic from `PosDtoMapper` and `UserDtoMapper` into a generic `DtoMapper`.
- Move common logic from `PosService` and `UserService` into a generic `CrudService`.
- Move common logic from `PosServiceImpl` and `UserServiceImpl` to generic `CrudServiceImpl`.
- Move common logic from `PosEntityMapper` and `UserEntityMapper` to generic `EntityMapper`.
- Move common logic from `PosDataService` and `UserDataService` to generic `DataService`.
- Move common logic from `PosDataServiceImpl` and `UserDataServiceImpl` to generic `CrudDataServiceImpl`.
